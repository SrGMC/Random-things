## How it works
This smart roulette works by tracking where every body part of every player in the match is placed and generates a pseudorandom result based on all the dots available, and without repeating the previous combination or body part/colour combination, so you don't have to spin again.  
And to be more accurate you can remove disqualified players.
  
## TODO
-[] Implement modes (Easy, Medium and Hard)
